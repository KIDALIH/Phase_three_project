# CHURN PREDICTION FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR
## Business Understanding

According to Wikipidea the telecommunications industries within the sector of information and communication technology is made up of all telecommunications/telephone companies and internet service providers and plays a crucial role in the evolution of mobile communications and the information society.

Traditional telephone calls continue to be the industry's biggest revenue generator, but thanks to advances in network technology, telecom today is less about voice and increasingly about text (messaging, email) and images (e.g. video streaming). High-speed internet access for computer-based data applications such as broadband information services and interactive entertainment is pervasive. Digital subscriber line (DSL) is the main broadband telecom technology. The fastest growth comes from (value-added) services delivered over mobile networks.
## Business Problem
The telecommunication industry is quite capital intensive and requires recruitment and retention of a wide customer base in order to spread overheads. The industry guidance is that the cost of acquiring a new customer is more than the cost of retaining an existing customer. Consequently, churn prediction ,which is detecting which customers are likely to leave , is imperative because the company can then focus on retention of existing customers who are likely to leave.
## Objective
Develop a classification model for churn prediction in order to guide customer retention strategies.
